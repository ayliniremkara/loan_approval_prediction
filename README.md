# Loan Approval Prediction Project
For financial companies, it is of utmost importance to check their customers for eligibility for loans. In order to speed up the decision-making process utilization of machine learning models is much needed.
In this project, a machine learning model is created to predict whether customers are eligible for a loan based on their financial data. Additionally, REST API is developed using Python and Flask to serve the trained model for production use.

## Technologies
The project is created with:
- Python 3.11
- Flask 3.0.0
- Gunicorn 21.2.0
- Pandas 2.1.1
- Joblib 1.3.2
- Scikit-learn 1.3.1
- Docker 24.0.6

## Task 1: Training and Evaluating the Model

In this task, training and evaluating machine learning algorithms to predict the loan status of clients. The end goal is to provide a comprehensive classification report summarizing the models' performance.


## Task 2: Developing a REST API and Deployment

After training and evaluating the model, the next step is to deploy it on a production server. RES API is developed using Python and Flask. The primary responsibility of the API is to accept client data and return the prediction results based on the selected and trained model in Task 1. Additionally, Docker is used to containerize the application for production deployment. The project also includes logging and exception handling.
