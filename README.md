# Loan Approval Prediction Project
For financial companies, it is of utmost importance to check their customers for eligibility to loan. In order to speed up the decision making process utilization of machine learning models is much needed.
In this project, I have created a machine learning model to predict whether customers are eligible for a loan based on their financial data. Additionally, I have developed a REST API using Python and Flask to serve the trained model for production use.
