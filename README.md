# Loan Approval Prediction Project
For financial companies, it is of utmost importance to check their customers for eligibility to loan. In order to speed up the decision making process utilization of machine learning models is much needed.
In this project, a machine learning model is created to predict whether customers are eligible for a loan based on their financial data. Additionally, REST API is developed using Python and Flask to serve the trained model for production use.
